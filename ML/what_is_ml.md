**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to **learn from data** and **improve their performance** without being explicitly programmed for every specific task.

## ðŸ§  Core Definition

> **Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act based on data, without being explicitly programmed.**

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of ML

To build models that can **make predictions or decisions** based on **past data (training data)** and **generalize** to unseen data (test data).

## ðŸ“Š Example

- Traditional Program:  
  You write explicit logic:
  ```python
  if age > 60:
      return "Senior"
- Machine Learning Program:
  You feed labeled examples (age â†’ category), and the system learns the pattern.
