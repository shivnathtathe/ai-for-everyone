# ðŸ¤– What is Machine Learning?

**Machine Learning (ML)** is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that gives computers the ability to **learn from data** and **improve their performance** without being explicitly programmed for every specific task.

## ðŸ§  Core Definition

> **Machine Learning is the science of getting computers to learn and act based on data, without being explicitly programmed.**

[Wikipedia Definition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning)

Machine learning (ML) is a field of study in artificial intelligence concerned with the development and study of statistical algorithms that can learn from data and generalise to unseen data, and thus perform tasks without explicit instructions.[1] Within a subdiscipline in machine learning, advances in the field of deep learning have allowed neural networks, a class of statistical algorithms, to surpass many previous machine learning approaches in performance.[2]

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal of ML

To build models that can **make predictions or decisions** based on **past data (training data)** and **generalize** to unseen data (test data).

## ðŸ“Š Example

- Traditional Program:  
  You write explicit logic:
  ```python
  if age > 60:
      return "Senior"
- Machine Learning Program:
  You feed labeled examples (age â†’ category), and the system learns the pattern.
