# 🤖 What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of computer science that aims to create systems capable of **performing tasks that normally require human intelligence**.

These tasks include:
- Learning from experience (like humans do)
- Understanding language
- Recognizing patterns (images, speech, etc.)
- Solving problems and making decisions

## 🧠 Core Definition

> **AI is the simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think, reason, and learn.**

## 💡 AI is the New Electricity

> _“AI is the new electricity.”_  
> — **Andrew Ng**, Co-founder of Google Brain and Coursera Founder of [DeepLearning.AI](deeplearning.ai)

Just like electricity transformed every industry 100 years ago, **AI is poised to do the same across every sector** — from healthcare and finance to transportation and education.

## 🧱 Subfields of AI

- **Machine Learning (ML)**: Systems that learn patterns from data.
- **Deep Learning (DL)**: ML using neural networks with many layers.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understanding human language.
- **Computer Vision**: Understanding images and video.
- **Robotics**: Physical systems with AI-based decision-making.
- **Expert Systems**: Rule-based decision engines.

## 🏁 Goal of AI

To build systems that can:
- Automate intelligent tasks (e.g., chatbots, self-driving cars)
- Enhance human productivity (e.g., AI copilots, recommendations)
- Operate independently in complex environments

## 📘 Quick Example

- **Spam filter in Gmail**: Learns what emails are spam by observing patterns.
- **ChatGPT**: Understands and generates natural language using deep learning.
- **Tesla Autopilot**: Uses sensors + AI models to make driving decisions.

## 🧭 Types of AI (based on capability)

1. **Narrow AI**: Specialized at one task (e.g., Google Search, Siri)
2. **General AI**: Can perform any intellectual task a human can (not yet real)
3. **Superintelligent AI**: Hypothetical future system that surpasses human intelligence

---

## 🔚 Summary

AI is transforming industries by enabling machines to think, learn, and act intelligently. It forms the foundation for modern applications like chatbots, virtual assistants, recommendation engines, autonomous vehicles, and much more.

> 🚀 AI is not just the future — it's already shaping our present.
