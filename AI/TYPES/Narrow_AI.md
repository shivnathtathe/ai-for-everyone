# Narrow AI (Artificial Narrow Intelligence)

## What is Narrow AI?

Narrow AI, also called Weak AI, refers to AI systems designed to perform **one specific task** extremely well. These systems operate under limited pre-defined functions and cannot generalize beyond their programming.

They **lack consciousness or genuine intelligence** but can outperform humans at the tasks they are designed for.

---

## Characteristics

- Performs a **single task** or a narrow range of tasks.
- Operates under **predefined rules and datasets**.
- Does not possess self-awareness or genuine understanding.
- Cannot adapt to tasks outside its specific domain.

---

## Examples of Narrow AI

- Voice assistants like **Amazon Alexa**, **Apple Siri**, and **Google Assistant**.
- **Spam email filters** that detect and block unwanted messages.
- **Recommendation systems** used by Netflix and Amazon.
- **Image recognition** tools used for tagging photos.
- **Chess engines** like IBM’s Deep Blue.
