# General AI (Artificial General Intelligence)

## What is General AI?

General AI, or Strong AI, refers to AI systems that possess **human-level intelligence** and can perform **any intellectual task** that a human can.

Unlike Narrow AI, General AI can **understand, learn, and apply knowledge flexibly** across diverse domains.

---

## Characteristics

- Ability to understand, learn, and reason across **multiple domains**.
- Exhibits **self-awareness** and consciousness (theoretical).
- Can generalize knowledge from one task to another.
- Possesses **cognitive abilities similar to humans**.

---

## Current Status

- General AI remains a **theoretical concept** and is a major goal in AI research.
- No existing AI system has achieved true General AI yet.
- Requires advancements in areas like common sense reasoning, creativity, and emotional understanding.
