# Types of Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence can be broadly classified into different types based on **capabilities** and **functionalities**. Understanding these types helps to grasp how AI systems vary in complexity and application.

## 1. Based on Capabilities

| Type            | Description                                      | Example                     |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| [Narrow AI](TYPES/Narrow_AI.md)       | AI designed to perform a specific task          | Voice assistants, Spam filters |
| [General AI](TYPES/General_AI.md)      | AI with human-level intelligence across tasks   | Hypothetical, research goal |
| [Superintelligent AI](TYPES/Superintelligent_AI.md) | AI that surpasses human intelligence          | Future theoretical concept  |

## 2. Based on Functionalities

| Type                    | Description                                       | Example                         |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Reactive Machines        | AI that reacts to inputs without memory          | Deep Blue (chess-playing AI)    |
| Limited Memory          | AI that uses past data for decision-making        | Self-driving cars                |
| Theory of Mind          | AI that can understand emotions and beliefs (future) | Research area, not yet built    |
| Self-aware AI           | AI with self-consciousness and awareness (theoretical) | Science fiction level AI         |
